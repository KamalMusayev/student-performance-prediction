Overview

This project involves building and evaluating a machine learning regression model. The model's performance is assessed using standard regression metrics to ensure reliability, accuracy, and generalization.

Performance Metrics

Below are the model evaluation results on both the training and test datasets.

Training Data

R² Score: 0.9052

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.72

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 12.33

Test Data

R² Score: 0.8127

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3.84

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 22.98

Why These Metrics Are Used

R² Score: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

MAE: Represents the average magnitude of errors, providing an interpretable measure of accuracy.

MSE: Penalizes larger errors more heavily, helping identify significant deviations.

Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas
